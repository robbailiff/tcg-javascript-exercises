Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with ‘*****’, 
except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. 

For example:
fixStart(‘babble’): ‘ba**le’
fixStart(‘turtle’): ‘tur*le’

======================================

CREATE a function with a single ARGUMENT

    CREATE a variable and store the first letter of ARGUMENT

    LOOP over ARGUMENT from second character a number of times equal to its length
        IF the letter at the current index is equal to the first letter
            REPLACE it with a star

    PRINT ARGUMENT
