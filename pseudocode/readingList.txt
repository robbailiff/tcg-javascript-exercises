Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and already read 
(a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: “The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien”.

Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit” by J.R.R. Tolkien’, 
and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’

============================

CREATE an array to store the book objects

LOOP through each book object in array
    PRINT book title and book author
    IF it has already been read
        PRINT 'Already read' statement
    else
        PRINT 'NOT read' statement
